Argus Event Examples 3.0
QoSient, LLC
http://qosient.com/argus

Argus, running as a daemon, can be configured to run programs
periodically, and to transport the resulting output as an
ARGUS_EVENT.  This basic mechanism, allows argus to collect
additional situational awareness data and insert it into the
argus flow data stream.  

See the configuration support descriptions in argus.conf.5 for
details on this feature.

The types of information envisioned for this feature is SNMP
collected data, system information, such as resource utilization,
temperature, open files and syslog information.  But it is not
limited to these simple examples.

The system is designed to collect and transport ASCII output,
upto 64K in length, so it will support unstructured data.
The examples below, however, implement a structured approach, to
aid argus data collectors, mediators and analysis engines the
ability to parse and use the data.

This directory contains perl and shell scripts to generate the
data for the argus events functions.

These scripts were developed on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and as
such may not port cleanly.  As a result, we do not install these
programs in the automated installation process.

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu

************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send problems, bug reports, questions and comments to the argus
mailing list at Carnegie Mellon University:

argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus. Argusbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.

************************************************************

Comprehensive network transaction auditing is an extremely powerful
network management tool, and a large number of sites can benefit from
the prototype work that has been done through the Argus Project.

Again, thank you for your interest in Argus.  I hope that you find
the software useful.
