Argus 3.0.6
QoSient, LLC
http://qosient.com/argus

This directory contains source code for Argus, an IP network
transaction auditing tool, that generates a persistent audit of all
network transactions and their performance.  The data that Argus
generates can be used for a wide range of tasks including
Network Operations, Security, Assurance and Performance Management.

To install the software and get started, see the ./INSTALL file.
For answers to many questions, please see the ./docs/FAQ file.

The Argus 3.0 has been ported to SunOS and Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, NetBSD and Irix, and the sample client code has
been successfully used under most variants of Unix.  If you port
Argus to another system, please let us know on the mailing list.

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu

************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send problems, bug reports, questions and comments to the argus
mailing list at Carnegie Mellon University:

argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus. Argusbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.

************************************************************

Comprehensive network transaction auditing is an extremely powerful
network management tool, and a large number of sites can benefit from
the prototype work that has been done through the Argus Project.

Again, thank you for your interest in Argus.  I hope that you find
the software useful.
