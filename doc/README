Man page conversion to pdf's is done with the shell script below, using 
Ghostscript's ps2pdf on Mac OS X, where "man -t" generates postscript output.  
This maybe the case on all Unix's but not sure about that.

for i in man/*/*; \
do echo $i; \
   man -t $i | ps2pdf - `echo $i | sed -e "s/man/doc\/pdf\/man/"`.pdf; \
done

For Mac OS X, use pstopdf.

for i in man/*/*; \
do echo $i; \
   man -t $i | pstopdf -i -o `echo $i | sed -e "s/man/doc\/pdf\/man/"`.pdf; \
done
